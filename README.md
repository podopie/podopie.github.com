Heypodo Repo
============

What is this
------------
Just over a year ago, I decided to write my personal website. Now, it hosts my blog.


Why github
----------
I went back and forth about hosting this elsewhere. Github is free, minimal, and lets me do everything I need to do, and gives me control over everything I need control over.

What can I do
-------------
As this repo grows, please do not use any of my content without asking first (email is in my github profile). Otherwise, I love feedback--so if there's anything I write about (or my code sucks), send me a note!
