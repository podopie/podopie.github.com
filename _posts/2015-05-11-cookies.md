Today's recipe comes from  <a href='http://www.thekitchenmagpie.com/chocolate-chip-cookie-recipe-thick-n-chewy'>The Kitchen Magpie</a>. The goal was to duplicate the "height" of her cookie. I don't think it was successful, but the batter came out fantastic and was happy with the result.

I halved the recipe due to being low on sugar.

## Conversion from Volume to Weight

Ingredient          | Original | Weight
:-------------------|:-----------|:------
baking soda         | 0.5 tsp    | 4 grams
brown sugar         | 0.5 cups   | 110 grams
butter              | 0.25 cup   | 56.5 grams
chocolate chips     | 1 cup      | 152 grams
egg                 | 1 egg      | 
flour               | 1.125 cups | 144 grams
granulated sugar    | 0.25 cups  | 50 grams
salt                | 0.5 tsp    | 4 grams
vanilla extract     | 0.75 tsp   | 5 grams

## A note on cleanup

One thing I love about cooking by weight: the cleanup is easy. Half of what's in the sink isn't from baking. But everything I used is in the sink.

## Results

The batter came out incredibly smooth; like with the cheesecake, importance is in balance between the ingredients, and also getting the butter to room temperature. Otherwise you end up with a chunky batter.

After folding in the chocolate chips, it was clear this was a "heavy" cookie: the chips amounted to the majority of the cookie dough (note: I am okay with that). Cookies came out larger than expected.

Recommended time was 10-12 minutes; since my cookies ended up larger I went on the longer side to make sure they were baked through.

A++ bake again.
